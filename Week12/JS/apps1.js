/*
Create an application with three grey, square divs, in a row. 
They should be 200px by 200px, and all floated left. Give them a margin of 5px.

Using only one event handler, write event listeners to respond to a click on each element. 
Each element should change to a different color: one red, one green, and one blue. Use a data attribute on the elements to store the color to be changed to.

The result, after clicking on the first and third, should look something like this:

function morph(event){
    let hue = event.target.getAttribute("data-hue");
    event.target.style.backgroundColor = hue;
