//Drawing Drawer

//Create a composition of some object - a car, a rocket, a set of keys.
//Move that composition code into a new function ("drawKeys()", for instance).
//Add two arguments to the function (x and y)
//Use those arguments to control the position of each of the drawing calls in the function (things like rect() and circle())
//Finally, either:
//Place the function call in the draw() function, and have your composition follow mouseX and mouseY
//Draw 3+ of your compositions in different spaces on the screen by writing your function call three or more times in either setup() or draw()

function setup(){
    createCanvas(800, 600);
    }
    


    function draw(){
    background(220);
